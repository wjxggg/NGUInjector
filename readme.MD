# NGUInjector

NGUInjector is an automation platform for the steam version of NGU Idle.

# Instructions

Releases can be found in the releases section of the github page [here](https://github.com/JConquistador/NGUInjector/releases). Do not download the source code archive, instead download the zip file with the release version in the name (dist_3.6.3.zip for example). Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice. To start automation, run inject.bat in the extracted folder when NGU Idle is open.

You'll know the injection has worked if you see the following in the upper left portion of NGU.

To upgrade to a new release, unload the injector from the General Settings page and then inject the new version.

# Configuration

**IMPORTANT NOTE** For those upgrading from an older version of NGUInjector (< 3.7.0), your configuration folder will be recreated in the directory shown below. Your old settings and profiles are NOT gone. Simply copy the old NGUInjector folder from the desktop to the new location.

After injecting the dll, a new folder will be created in your AppData directory called NGUInjector (full path is %UserProfile%\AppData\LocalLow\NGUInjector). Settings files will be automatically written to this directory. The following files are of interest:

- **settings.json** - Contains settings used by the application. Most settings can be configured from the in-game menu.
- **zoneOverrides.json** - Override the default values for Idle/Manual Power/Toughness for gold sniping

A profiles folder will be created with the following files:

- **default.json** - Breakpoints for assigning gear, magic, energy, wandoos OS, rebirth time, and diggers. See the allocation section for more information

More profiles can be added to this folder at your discretion.

A logs folder will also be created with the following files:

- **loot.log** - Logs all the loot dropped by enemies.
- **inject.log** - Logs general information about the injector
- **combat.log** - Logs information from the combat algorithm
- **allocation.log** - Logs information about allocating energy/magic/gear/diggers
- **pitspin.log** - Logs important things like fruit harvests, money pit, daily spin. This log file will not be overwritten.

Saving settings.json, zoneOverrides.json, or any profile will automatically reload the settings in the Injector. Reloading the game isn't necessary

# Settings.json Configurations

With the latest fork, many changes have been added that aren't found in the GUI.

To access these settings, open the **settings.json** (in your AppData NGUInjector folder, mentioned above) and scroll down to find the following configuration options:

- **\_manageCooking** - Set this to true to have the injector optimize your cooking efficiency
- **\_manageCookingLoadouts** - Set this to true to have the injector swap to a Cooking loadout when eating meals
- **\_cookingLoadout** - Assign your cooking loadout here. Follow similar pattern as other loadout fields (example: [448, 447, 444, 170, 263, 169, 128, 243, 136, 91, 446, 137, 256, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269])
- **\_wishBlacklist** - Assign wishes you never want to cast here. Any which in this list will be ignored when working out the wish priorities (example: [131, 132, 128, 135,139]
- **\_cardSortEnabled** - Set this to true to have the injector sort cards based on the priorities given in **\_cardSortOrder**. (**false** by default).
- **\_cardSortOrder** - Give a list of priorities to sort the cards by. The cards will be sorted by the first priority, then any cards that match will be sorted by the second priority, and so on. The available priority options are:
  - **"RARITY"** - The card rarity ("Good"/"Okay", etc.). (high->low)
  - **"TIER"** - The card tier. (high->low)
  - **"COST"** - The total mayo cost. (high->low)
  - **"PROTECTED"** - Whether the card is protected. (protected, then not protected)
  - **"CHANGE"** - The actual change in the bonus. (e.g. if you're current total Wish bonus is 200%, and the card bonus is 2%, the change will be 1%). (high->low)
  - **"VALUE"** - The CHANGE value divided by the card cost. (high->low)
  - **"NORMALVALUE"** - The VALUE, normalized by the card bonus type. (e.g. Gold always gives higher changes than PP, so this will try to account for that). (high->low)
  - **"TYPE:xxxx"** - The card bonus type. Replace 'xxxx' with a specific card bonus type, i.e. one of: "energyNGUSpeed", "magicNGUSpeed", "wandoosSpeed", "augSpeed", "TMSpeed", "hackSpeed", "wishSpeed", "atkDefStats", "adventureStat", "dropChance", "goldDrop", "dayCareSpeed", "PP", "QP".
  - **Example:**
    ```
      "_cardSortEnabled": true,
      "_cardSortOrder": ["PROTECTED", "TYPE:adventureStat", "TYPE:hackSpeed", "VALUE"]
    ```
    This will place any protected cards first, then if multiple are protected, it will prioritise adv. stat cards, then hack speed cards, then for any others (as well as adv. and hack cards that are both protected) it will order them by their value.

# Log Parsing

Discord user WookieeNo1 has made a PowerShell script to prettify the log files. If you are interested in this, check out the github here: https://github.com/WookieeNo1/NGUIdleInjector-Pretty-Print

This is what it looks like once you set it up:

If this is checked, wishes will be assigned to slots by the remaining time to complete the current level of the wish instead. For example Wish 9 and Wish 10 both have the same raw speed, if this option is unchecked, Wish 9 will go to max level before any levels are gained in Wish 10. But since each additional level adds more time to the raw speed, if this option is checked, Wish 9 and 10 will gain levels equally.

# Allocation

Allocation profiles can be found in the profiles folder and contain time breakpoints for configuring your gear, diggers, energy allocation and magic allocation. Sample allocation files can be found in the sampleprofile folder.

[Sample 24 Hour Profile](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/blob/master/NGUInjector/SampleProfiles/24hr_with_gear.json).

The time portion of every breakpoint refers to rebirth time in seconds. Time can be defined as a simple number (ex: 86400) or as a JSON object:

```
"Time": {
    "h": 1,
    "m": 30,
    "s": 20
},
```

Priorities can be modified with an optional percentage cap by adding a : and a percent. As an example:

```
CAPWISH-0:30
```

This will cap wish 0 but limit the maximum amount allocated to 30% of your current cap. When applied to non-cap priorities, it will limit to % of idle resource. Priorities will respect targets and not allocate to priorities that are target capped.

## Energy

An energy breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"Energy": [
    {
        "Time": 0,
        "Priorities": ["CAPNGU-0", "CAPWAN", "AT-1", "NGU-1"]
    }
]

```

Priorities come in 2 types - cap and non-cap. Any priority that has -X after it is 0 indexed.

A cap priority will use as much idle energy as possible and hit the highest BB breakpoint possible for the next 10 seconds. A non-cap priority will take a divider of your idle energy based on number of non-cap priorities and attempt to hit the highest BB breakpoint possible for the next 10 seconds. When a priority is calculated, it will push excess energy to later priorities.

In the above example the following actions will be taken:

- NGU-0 (NGU Augments) will be capped
- Wandoos energy will be capped
- Remaining energy will be split between AT-1 (Advanced Training Power) and NGU-1 (NGU Wandoos)

Available cap priorities for Energy are as follows:

- CAPNGU-X (0-8) - Calculate a cap for the NGU
- CAPALLNGU - Calculate a cap for every NGU starting from 0
- CAPAT-X (0-4) - Calculate a cap for the AT and attempt to BB it.
- CAPALLAT - Calculate caps for all ATs and BB them.
- CAPBESTAUG - Attempts to allocate to the best augment possible. Before pairs are unlocked, will allocate to highest augment that is easily doable. After will try to optimize.
- CAPWAN - Calculate a cap for wandoos energy
- CAPTM - Calculate a cap for energy time machine and attempt to BB it.
- CAPBT-X (0-11) - Calculate a cap for basic training
- CAPALLBT - Caps all basic trainings
- CAPAUG-X (0-13) - Calculate a cap for augments and attempt to BB it
- CAPWISH-X (0-X) - Allocate energy to wishes. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate to. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes

Available non-cap priorities for Energy are as follows:

- ALLNGU - Allocate energy to every NGU
- NGU-X (0-8) - Allocate energy to NGU
- AT-X (0-4) - Allocate energy to AT
- ALLAT - Allocate energy to all AT
- AUG-X (0-13) - Allocate energy to augment
- BESTAUG - Attempts to allocate to the best augment possible. Before pairs are unlocked, will allocate to highest augment that is easily doable. After will try to optimize.
- WAN - Allocate energy to energy wandoos
- TM - Allocate energy to energy time machine
- BT-X (0-11) - Allocate energy to basic training
- WISH-X (0-X) - Allocate energy to wishes. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate to. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes

More information on allocation indexes can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Allocation-Indexes)

## Magic

A magic breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"Magic": [
    {
        "Time": 0,
        "Priorities": ["CAPNGU-0", "CAPWAN", "BR", "NGU-1"]
    }
]

```

Priorities come in 2 types - cap and non-cap. Any priority that has -X after it is 0 indexed.

A cap priority will use as much idle energy as possible and hit the highest BB breakpoint possible for the next 10 seconds. A non-cap priority will take a divider of your idle energy based on number of non-cap priorities and attempt to hit the highest BB breakpoint possible for the next 10 seconds. When a priority is calculated, it will push excess energy to later priorities.

In the above example the following actions will be taken:

- NGU-0 (NGU Yggdrasil) will be capped
- Wandoos magic will be capped
- Magic rituals will be capped from highest to lowest, with rituals taking more than 1 hour skipped
- Remaining magic will be allocated to NGU-1 (NGU Exp)

Available cap priorities for Magic are as follows:

- CAPNGU-X (0-6) - Use the cap button for the NGU
- CAPALLNGU - Use the cap button for every NGU starting from 0
- CAPWAN - Use the cap button for wandoos magic
- CAPTM - Calculate a cap for magic time machine and attempt to BB it.
- CAPRIT-X - Calculate a cap for the ritual and allocate
- CAPWISH-X (0-X) - Allocate magic to wishes. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate to. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes
- BR - Cast rituals from highest to lowest ignoring rituals you cant afford or will take more than an hour
- BR-X - Cast rituals from highest to lowest that will finish before time specified by X. BR-3600 will cast rituals that will end before the 1 hour mark from your current time.

Available non-cap priorities for Magic are as follows:

- NGU-X (0-6) - Allocate energy to NGU
- WAN - Allocate energy to magic wandoos
- TM - Allocate energy to magic time machine
- RIT-X - Allocate energy to ritual
- WISH-X (0-X) - Allocate magic to wishes. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate to. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes

More information on allocation indexes can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Allocation-Indexes)

## R3

An R3 breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"R3": [
    {
        "Time": 0,
        "Priorities": ["HACK-1"]
    }
]

```

Available priorities for R3 are as follows:

- (CAP)HACK-X (0-14) - Allocate R3 to hacks. Will only ever allocate to the first hack in your priority list that hasn't met its target.
- (CAP)ALLHACK - Adds every hack from 0 to 14 as a priority
- (CAP)WISH-X (0-X) - Allocate R3 to wishes. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate to. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes

## Gear

A gear breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"Gear": [
    {
        "Time": 0,
        "ID": [189, 442, 160, 441, 148, 169, 139, 184, 187, 185, 186, 188]
    }
]

```

The list of IDs is the IDs of the gear desired.

You can dump your loadouts from Gear Optimizer using the method found on [this wiki page](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Dump-Equipment-from-GO)

## Diggers

A digger breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"Diggers": [
    {
        "Time": 3650,
        "List": [3, 4, 5, 8]
    }
]

```

The list of diggers is 0 indexed. Drop chance digger is 0, EXP digger is 11. More information can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Allocation-Indexes)

## Wandoos

A wandoos breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"Wandoos": [
    {
        "Time": 0,
        "OS": 1
    }
]

```

The OS is 0 indexed. Wandoos 98 is 0, Wandoos MEH is 1, Wandoos XL is 2

## NGU Difficulty

A NGU Difficulty breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"NGUDiff": [
    {
    "Time": 0,
    "Diff": 0
    }
]
```

The difficulty is 0 indexed. Normal NGUs is 0, Evil NGUs is 1, Sadistic NGUs is 2

## Rebirth

Rebirth Breakpoints can be written 2 ways. A simple time based breakpoint is written as follows:

```
"RebirthTime": -1
```

A setting of -1 means no rebirths. Otherwise rebirth will be performed when the time in seconds is reached.

More complex rebirth breakpoints can be done as follows:

```
"Rebirth": {
    "Type": "Time",
    "Target": {
    "h": 24,
    "m": 1
    },
    "Challenges": []
},
```

The following types are available:

- **Time** - Rebirths when a certain time passes
- **Number** - Rebirths when your number will be OldNumber \* _Target_
- **Bosses** - Rebirths when you can defeat _Target_ additional bosses
- **Muffin** - Rebirths to optimize Muffin consumable usage. Will cycle between 24 and 23 hour Time rebirths. Set _Target_ to 1 to auto purchase Muffins. Will simply perform 24 hour Time rebirths without Muffin use if any of the following conditions are met:
  - Currently in a challenge
  - Has any challenges defined in the Rebirth Breakpoint
  - 5 O'Clock Shadow Perk or Beast Fertilizer Quirk aren't maxed
  - Do not have any Muffins and cannot buy more (or is configured to not buy more)

The following example will rebirth when your number is 10x your previous number:

```
"Rebirth": {
    "Type": "Number",
    "Target": 10,
    "Challenges": []
},
```

The following example will rebirth when you can kill 5 more bosses than your last rebirth:

```
"Rebirth": {
    "Type": "Bosses",
    "Target": 5,
    "Challenges": []
},
```

The following example will perform "Muffin" rebirth cycles, purchasing Muffin consumables if none are available:

```
"Rebirth": {
    "Type": "Muffin",
    "Target": 1,
    "Challenges": []
},
```

Additionally, you may specify challenges to rebirth into. The following string correspond to challenges:

- **BASIC** - Basic
- **NOAUG** - No Augments
- **24HR** - 24 Hour
- **100LC** - 100 Level Challenge
- **NOEC** - No Equipment
- **TC** - Troll Challenge
- **NORB** - No Rebirth
- **LSC** - Laser Sword Challenge
- **BLIND** - Blind Challenge
- **NONGU** - No NGU
- **NOTM** - No Time Machine

Challenges must be given a number afterwards to specify which challenge is being completed. Challenges start at 1. Ex:

```
"Challenges": ["BASIC-1", "BASIC-2", "TC-1","NOEQ-1"]
```

## Consumables

A Consumables breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"Consumables": [
    {
    "Time": 0,
    "Items": ["EPOT-B", "MPOT-B"]
    }
]
```

Consumables are indexed as follows:

- **EPOT-A** - Energy Potion alpha
- **EPOT-B** - Energy Potion beta
- **EPOT-C** - Energy Potion delta
- **MPOT-A** - Magic Potion alpha
- **MPOT-B** - Magic Potion beta
- **MPOT-C** - Magic Potion delta
- **R3POT-A** - R3 Potion alpha
- **R3POT-B** - R3 Potion beta
- **R3POT-C** - R3 Potion delta
- **EBARBAR** - Energy Bar Bar
- **MBARBAR** - Magic Bar Bar
- **MUFFIN** - MacGuffin Muffin
- **LC** - Lucky Charm
- **SLC** - Super Lucky Charm
- **MAYO** - Mayo Infuser

Consumables can be modified with an optional number to use by adding a : and a number. As an example:

```
EPOT-A:2
```

This will use two Energy Potion alphas instead of one. Consumables which are active until the next rebirth (beta potions and Muffins) ignore this modification and will only ever consume one.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: BE AWARE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF CONSUMABLE BREAKPOINTS**

The injector cannot remember consumable usage across sessions. Therefore, if you restart NGU, restart the injector, or make any changes to/reload the profile, it **will** run your current Consumables breakpoint again. The injector will try to compensate by estimating the amount of time a consumable is expected to run and only use consumables when appropriate. But it is not perfect and there are limitations.

**_Example_**:
Let's say you have it set to use a two Lucky Charms 1 hour after rebirth.

If the profile initializes before 01:00:00 into the current rebirth and lucky charm is not currently running, the breakpoint will execute normally and you'll use the two Lucky Charms at the appropriate time.

However if the profile is inialized AFTER this point (due to restarting the game or reloading the profile in some way) or the consumable is running when the breakpoint executes, there are a few things which can happen:

- First we determine at what point the Lucky Charms would have expired if activated normally. In this case it would be two 30m charms activated at 01:00:00, so the expected end time is 02:00:00
- If the current time within 1 minute of the expected end time or later, the consumable will not be used
  - For example, if the profile is loaded at 01:59:00 or later, no lucky charms will be used
- If however the current time is between the breakpoint time and the expected end time, we check to see if the boost is currently running and get the expected time left in the consumable by subtracting the current time from the total expected time the boost should run
  - For example, if the profile is loaded at 01:35:00, the expected time left in the boost would be 25 minutes
- If the boost is running 
  - If the "Use Consumables if already running" option is not selected, the consumable will not be used
  - If the time left on the boost is within 1 minute of the expected end time or later, the consumable will not be used
    - For example if there are 24 minutes or more left in the boost and the expected amount of time left is 25 minutes, no lucky charms will be used
- If we make it to this point, check to see how many consumables should be used (if any)
  - Get the total amount of time we need to add to the consumable timer by subtracting the time left (if any) from the total expected time left that the boost should be running
    - For example if the profile is loaded at 01:35:00 and there are 0 minutes left in the boost time, the amount of time we'd need to add is 25 minutes (so the lucky charm expires at 02:00:00). If there is 15 minutes left in the boost time we'd need to add 10 minutes.
  - Get the number of consumables to use by dividing the amount of time to add by the amount of time each consumable adds to the timer and rounding the result to get as close to the expiration as possible
    - For example if we need to add 25 minutes to the boost time, we'd consume 1 of the 2 lucky charms: 25/30 = .833 => 1. If we need to add 10 minutes to the boost time we'd consume 0 of the 2 lucky charms: 10/30 = .333 => 0

Beta potions and MacGuffin Muffins only activate if not already active. MacGuffin Muffin is a special case in that it lasts until the next rebirth AND for 24 hours, whichever is longer. If MacGuffin Muffin has gone through a rebirth, it will no longer be "Active" and will use the same timing logic as other non-beta consumables.

There is **NO** consideration for possibility that two of the same consumable can be added to a single breakpoint, multiple breakpoints overlapping, or the fact that alpha and delta potions share a timer. Injector will evaluate whether to use each consumable independant of any other configured consumables.

Be mindful of these limitations or your AP will be sad. No one likes sad AP.

# Zone Stat Overrides

The optimal zone for gold sniping is calculated using a set of values from pins that show stats necessary to do each zone. If the manual threshold is met for a zone, the script will snipe a boss without fast combat. If the idle threshold is met, the script will snipe a boss using fast combat. Beast Mode will always be turned off for this.

The stats for the zones can be manually overriden using the `zoneOverrides.json` file in the user's directory. For the default stats used see [here](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Default-Zone-Stats-for-Sniping)
