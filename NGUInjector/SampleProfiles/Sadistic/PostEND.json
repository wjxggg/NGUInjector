	"Final Note 2": "Aug/Wandoos if desired, but there isn't much reason to make Number Go Up anymore as we don't need to unlock any zones or titans",
	"Final Note 3": "Avoid rebirths, it is difficult to BB SAD NGUs and the slow increase of the NGU Beard is one of the only ways to improve your NGU speed factor now",
	"Final Note 4": "Doing muffin RB will improve your NGU macguffins, but at this point it scales slower than just letting the beard accumulate",
	"Final Note 5": "Wishes are likely the first to complete, remove all wish gear and focus on NGU/Power, move all Energy/Magic to NGUs (R3 is now useless)",
	"Final Note 6": "Once Perks/Quirks are done, we don't care about respawn or power anymore and NGUs are more easily capped, anything goes as long as NGU stays capped",
	"Final Note 7": "Maxing NGUs takes >200 days even when BB'd, this will be the final 'cap-able' stat (unless you go nuts and want to hardcap cap Energy/Magic/R3 through exp or something)",
