	"PriorityExample1" : "For example, with priorities A, CAPB, C, D, E and total energy of 100",
	"PriorityExample2" : "A would get 25 energy (1/4 of 100 idle energy) as there are 4 non-cap priorities to allocate (A,C,D,E)",
	"PriorityExample3" : "CAPB would then take as much as it needs to cap (lets say it takes 60)",
	"PriorityExample4" : "C, D, E would then get each get 5 energy (1/3 each of 15 remaining idle energy) - technically C gets 1/3 of 15, D then gets 1/2 of 10 and then E gets all of 5, but has the same outcome",

	"PriorityPercentComment1" : "The percentages (like ALLAT:25) are a ceiling, and wont have an effect if the amount of energy to be allocated is less than the percent would allocate",
	"PriorityPercentComment2" : "So if we had priority A with idle energy of 100 and the amount of energy to be applied was 20, A:25 would do nothing, while A:10 would lower the allocation to 10",
	"PriorityPercentComment3" : "Also a reminder that CAP allocations work against the total, while non-CAP allocations work against the idle amount",
	
	"PriorityPercentExample1" : "For example A, B, C, D would result in all priorities getting 25 energy and is equivalent to A:25, B:33, C:50, D:100 (A gets 25 of 100 idle, B gets 25 of 75 remainder, etc)",
